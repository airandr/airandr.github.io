Happy to share we got a new paper accepted at AIXIA2019 (International Conference of the Italian Association on Artificial intelligence)!

Vimercati M., Bianchi, F., Soto, M., & Palmonari, M. (2019). **Mapping Lexical Knowledge to Distributed Representations for Ontology Concept Invention.** In AIXIA.

In this paper we propose a novel model to do concept invention that combines neural multi task learning with 
distributed representations coming from distributional semantics and hyperbolic embeddings. We learn a mapping function from a distributed word space (ELMo) to distributed type spaces and show that this function can be used to invent (generate the representations) for unseen concept at test time!
