Happy to share we got a new paper accepted at AIXIA2019!

Vimercati M., Bianchi, F., Soto, M., & Palmonari, M. (2019). **Mapping Lexical Knowledge to Distributed Representations for Ontology Concept Invention.** In AIXIA. 

In this paper we propose a novel model to do concept invention that combines neural multi task learning with
distributed representations coming from distributional semantics and hyperbolic embeddings.
