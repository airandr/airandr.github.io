Happy to share we got a new paper accepted at paper accepted in AAAI-2019: "Training Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass". In this work we introduce a new temporal word embeddings model that extends the well known the Continuos Bag Of Word model introduced by Mikolov et al. in 2013.

Our  model is both easy to use and efficient and generates effective temporal word representations that can be used to evaluate temporal word similarity.

See you in Honolulu!
